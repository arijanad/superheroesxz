      <h3 class="card-title red">EXCLUSIVE: Rising Star Daniel Davids Talks Fame, Powers, Future and More</h3>
      <span class="card-text" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif;"><p>
When US teenager, Daniel Davids, started his Instagram account two and a half weeks ago, he never expected that it would end up reaching millions of people. The account, which hosts Daniel’s videos trialing different superpowers, has accumulated over fifty million followers and millions of views on his posts, and is increasingly gaining traction. However, Daniel has remained a mysterious figure to even his biggest supporters, mostly avoiding publicity and staying out of the public eye. That is until the last few days when he agreed to sit down for an exclusive interview for Superheroes-XZ.</p>

Q: Daniel, it’s great to meet you. First off thank you for agreeing to this interview, I understand that you must be in high demand right now…</p>

A: Yes, my pleasure. I admit that the past couple of weeks, and especially the last few days have been quite hectic for me. Working on the videos, alongside trying to finish the school year has kept me very busy. I’m overwhelmed with the response I’ve received.</p>

Q: Well let’s go back a little bit to the beginning. How, and why did you come about the decision to start the Instagram account and start posting the videos? Because for most of us, the process of finding out your superpowers is sort of a private matter… What made you decide to put yourself out there?</p>

A: To be honest, it never felt like a big or serious decision for me. For the last few months or so, all me and my friends would talk about would be finding out our superpowers, so I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. And as time went by, one by one, my friends started finding out what their powers were, until I was the only one left. So I thought I’d start the Instagram page just so I could make and post the videos to entertain my friends, and hopefully find my superpower in the process. You know… I never imagined that the videos would go viral and that millions of people would be following my journey.</p>

Q: And why do you think your videos have struck such a cord with today’s youth?</p>

A: To be honest I don’t know for sure. But reading the thousands of comments and messages which I now get on a daily basis, most of my followers seem to be kids my age who are also trying to figure out their power and testing things out. I think my videos have taken off because a lot of kids are having the exact same experience I’m having, and a lot of adults remember going through the same thing, so people can relate to the videos without necessarily knowing a lot about me.</p>

Q: Daniel, do you worry that you may have a low grade superpower, or, even though the chances are astronomically low, no super power? As you know, we’ve had late bloomers over the years who have raised a lot of speculation over the years but which eventually found their powers...What do you think about that?</p>

A: Well I would be lying if I said that it had not crossed my mind. At this point I’ve already tried most of the high grade powers and they didn’t work, so I’m coming to terms with the probability that my power will not be that impressive. But personally I don’t really think about the grades so much. I want to find out my power because I want to figure out where I belong and what my future is. Over the last few days I’ve been searching the index for the most common superpowers which I can try out, and at this point I’m having enough fun with the videos to keep me motivated. Now for the possibility that I have no superpower, it has also crossed my mind but I highly doubt that I would be the one person in the last 100 years which has no power. In fact I’ll be taking a genetic test at the IAA this week, so stay tuned to the Instagram account for the results.</p>

There you have it. As you can see Daniel is very much an average teenager. What makes him unique however is his willingness to be open and honest with his experience. Showing no signs of slowing down, one can only guess how popular the Instagram page will be, but everyone is following the journey and rooting for Daniel.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title red">How to find your ability?</h3>
      <p class="card-text" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif;">
        Now is a scary time in your life. You've reached the age where you are starting to change both mentally, and physically. Some things will be a mystery to you, some things will be more clear. Hopefully, we can help solve some of those mysteries. 
        <br>Maybe we'll help solve the most important mystery of all. What makes you special?
        The majority of the time, each individual is drawn to their powers. For example, those that have water related powers tend to have a love for swimming or water related activities. Those that like sport, tend to have some form of physical enhancement. If you like plants, maybe you have the ability to make things grow.</br> The key point is, embrace the hobbies, activities and other things that you like, as normally, there is a reason for you liking them. While you may not know what your power is, your body does, so will do whatever it can to try and show you the way. If you find that you do not have anything that particularly interests you, and are still struggling to find out what your power is, tell a teacher, and they will get in touch with someone that will try and help you even more.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title blue">How to correctly use your powers</h3>
      <p class="card-text" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif;">
      Great! You've finally figured out your powers! But now you're thinking: "Well, this is pretty cool, but what now?". That is a very valid question. Regardless of the power, it can still be used to benefit yourself, as well as others. So think of it this way... If you have fire powers, maybe become a cook. If you can control light, maybe work in the entertainment industry. If you can fly, go into the delivery business. Most importantly, do something that you enjoy, after all, if you enjoy something, you're probably going to be really good at it..</p>

      <p class="card-text" style="font-family:'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Popular musician Mini the Mico has released his album yesterday at 12.00. Mini used his frequency power in order to stream his songs on all music platforms and radios in town. It did not take long before he got arrested by the police on the grounds of power abuse. For his previous album release, Mini hacked the performance of Daria Dance to announce his second album. He got arrested for that action as well.  Even though it is illegal, we love the way Mini introduces his albums. MINI the MICO’s third album is now available on herofy and powercloud.</p>
